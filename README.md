# challenge_1_2430

This project is a BMI calculator. It takes age, height, weight, and gender to determine BMI.

This project is implemented as a column containing 4 rows, with each row containing buttons. The
column and rows use the Expand widget so that the buttons take up the whole screen. When the
buttons are pressed or values are changed in the fields, they are stored and used to calculate
the BMI. After pressing submit, a new page opens and the BMI and a message is displayed.
